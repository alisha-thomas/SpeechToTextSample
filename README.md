# SpeechToTextSample

This is a repository created to showcase the speech to text model trainings. 

The model needs to be trained with large set of datas to validate the accuracy. I have created this repository to upload different models that I have tried out. 

Some set of data that can be used to train is found here: https://www.openslr.org/12

The examples uses LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to learn and remember long-term dependencies in sequential data.

ReLU is used to introduce non-linearity into the network.
